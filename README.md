# FLU-Processor
We are making a processor for floating-point where we will be doing four operations, adder, subtractor, multiplier, and divisor. We are using the IEEE 754 standard to convert floating-point into 32-bit binary single-precision representation. We save our inputs and the outputs into the memory module and then use our controller module to call the different operations.
